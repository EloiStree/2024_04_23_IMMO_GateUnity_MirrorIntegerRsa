# 2024_04_23_IMMO_GateUnity_MirrorIntegerRsa
Unity project that you can connect to with Mirror to push Integer Value from your RSA Key. Only Push

This tool don't allow to listen to input change but to push on the shared server a new value to the integer you own with your RSA key.
There is a websocket server in C# in WS on that you can contact. 

Mirror has several transfert protocole that are not easy to code but very powerful.

The down side is that you need Unity to use this gate in that can be a bit to mush to just change integer value from time to time.
